                            Royal Belum is part of the Temenggor Forest Reserve, which has been home to several indigenous groups, such as the Temiar, Jahai, and other Orang Asli (indigenous) peoples, for centuries. These communities have lived in harmony with the forest, relying on its resources for food, shelter, and cultural practices. Their traditional knowledge of the land, flora, and fauna has been passed down through the generations.

                        <p class="text-muted">
                            These indigenous people maintain a sustainable lifestyle, practicing fishing, hunting, and agriculture, which are closely linked to the forest ecosystem.

                            During the British colonial era, the forests of the Malay Peninsula, including those around Royal Belum, were cleared for timber and other resources. The establishment of forest reserves during this period was intended to manage and protect the region's natural resources, although large-scale deforestation still occurred.

                            Temenggor, located in the heart of the Royal Belum area, was part of an early forest reserve system established by the British to safeguard timber resources.

                            Royal Belum State Park was officially designated as a forest reserve in 1993 by the Perak State Government. It covers an area of over 1,000 square kilometres, making it one of the largest protected forest areas in Peninsular Malaysia.

                            In 2007, Royal Belum was declared a state park, highlighting its importance in conservation efforts and as a critical area for biodiversity protection. The park is located in Perak, bordering Thailand to the north, and is an important part of the larger Belum-Temenggor Rainforest Complex.                        </p>
